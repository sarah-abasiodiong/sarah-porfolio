          Hello! My name is Sarah Akan, a software engineer based in Lagos,
          Nigeria. I'm thrilled to have you here. I have a passion for building
          amazing products that solve user problems, all while writing clean,
          reusable, and readable code. I embrace adventures because they push me
          out of my comfort zone and teach me new things. Currently, I work as a
          Frontend Engineer at Zedi Inc. In my free time, I enjoy singing (and
          yes, I have a good voice! ðŸ˜„), reading, learning new things, cooking,
          watching movies, and dancing (even though I'm not very good at it). I
          also love meeting new people and so let's connect and create interesting
          solutions together!
